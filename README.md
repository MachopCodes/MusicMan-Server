MusicMan is a networking application for the music community. Whether you're looking for clients to teach music lessons, find people to play music with, or finding a restaurant to play music at, this app is a launchpad to help you get your name out there. 

Link to client application: https://github.com/MachopCodes/musician-finder-client/edit/master/README.md

Each repo must contain the link to both deployed sites

Complete the repository Description field and Website field with a meaningful sentence description of the application and link to the live URL

Technologies Used: 
MongoDB
Mongoose
Express
Passport


Unsolved Problems:
Create routes to listen for specific searches. 
Ideally, the site would allow the user to search by different criterias, and ideally would send a GET request / listen for a GET request only for specific criteria, vs. indexing the entire database.
